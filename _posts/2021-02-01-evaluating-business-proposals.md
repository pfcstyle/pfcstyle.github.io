# Key vocabulary

1. Be prepared for a lot of **red tape**, as building regulations are very strict around here.
2. There aren't enough young people in this town to support your business-try to expand your **customer base**.
3. That **price point** seems little low for a luxury service.
4. I'm not convinced there's a **gap in the market**, since not many people are interested in comic books here.
5. Your equipment will need insurance and regular maintenance-those are two major **hidden costs**, that you haven't accounted for here.
6. Because you are mainly delivering within the inner city, I don't anticipate too many **logistical challenges**

# Proposals
A. Organicare will market high-end skincare and cosmetics to young women aged 18-25. We will ensure our products use 100% natural ingredients sourced from countries around the world. The price point will be quite high-around $90 for a face wash-but our customers will be drawn to our luxury image.

B. The $12 Haircut Bar will offer guick and simple haircuts to men of all ages at the lowest prices in the city! We can keep our prices low because we won't provide shampoos, blow drying, styling and other services.

C. Our city now has several Japanese restaurants, but we don't have any shops selling items of Japanese pop culture-comic books. soft toys, fashion accessories, etc. J-SHOP will sell a range of these authentic Japanese products to young locals who are interested in getting in on the Japan craze. 

# Comments

1. You'll need to watch out for red tape takes a long time to get approval for importing these ingredients. There's sure to be logistical challenges too.
2. How many young women have this kind of money?
3. There are hidden costs here-advertising in fashion magazines, etc. is very expensive.
4. Nice-this price point will appeal to your target market.
5. However, it's critical that you maintain high quality. No one can accept a terrible haircut!
6. I'm not convinced there's a gap in the market for a store like this. You'll have to look at how you can expand your customer base by selling online too.
