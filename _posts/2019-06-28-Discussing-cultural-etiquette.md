# Australian etiquette made easy


- A. Always be prepared to split the bill, but if someone in your group insists on covering everyone's meal, it's best to accept their offer graciously. Later, your friends might start buying 'rounds' of drinks. This means one person will buy a drink for everyone, until it's another person's turn to 'get the next round'. On these occasions, you should always buy a round yourself.

- B. Traditional Australian phrases such as'G'day mate!' have fallen out of fashion in many urban areas, so don't be surprised if your attempts to use them are seen as rude or embarrassing. Leading with a simple 'Hello' or 'Good morning' is a safer option, and will not cause any offence.

- C. Personal space is valued in Australia, so be wary of sitting or standing too closely to other passengers. Also, it's best to keep the volume down, as playing music or talking loudly is frowned upon in these settings.

- D. Asking "Shoes on or off?"when you arrive is common practice, as different people will have different preferences here. If dinner is being provided, avoid turning up empty handed. Presenting your host with a bottle of wine or a salad will show that you are grateful for their invitation.

- E. Bargaining is often acceptable in markets and street stalls, but it's important to offer a good price and possibly make additional purchases. Going too low with your initial offer may be considered insulting.
