# Dialogue

1. Anna: As mentioned in my email, we've received some customer complaints recently about our XK5 phones overheating. We've already issued refunds for those cases, but I want to see if there's a problem with the phones themselves.
2. Dillon: Sure, we can do a few tests on the XK5. But if there really is something wrong, we should probably recall the phones.
3. Lucas: Isn't it a bit too early to have that conversation? If I may, we need to remember that our reputation is at stake here. If we start recalling phones, that could have a negative impact on all of our other products. We're already struggling to meet the sales target this quarter. I don't think we should recall anything unless we absolutely have to.
4. Dillon: Sure. I think we can all agree that we should avoid that, but if there really is something wrong with our phones it'd be better to do something about it now than to ignore it.
5. Lucas: What's your opinion, Anna? It's your team that's been dealing directly with the customers so far after all.
6. Anna: Well, I think we definitely need to run some tests as soon as possible. Then my staff can at least say we're looking into the problem. And if Dillon's team could get us some questions to ask when customers complain, perhaps we can help resolve this issue. agree that it's too early to consider a recall, but Lucas, I think it would be a good idea to let your team know about this so they can make other recommendations to customers for now.
7. Lucas: Sure.
8. Dillon: And we'll get you a list of questions by the end of the day
9. Anna: Okay, great! Thanks! Let's have another meeting on Friday to review the situation and figure out next steps, shall we?
10. Lucas& Dillion:sure.
