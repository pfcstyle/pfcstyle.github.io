# Sample speech
The future of America is with its people, the fighters who are willing to sacrifice to make their dreams come
true. True optimists are not those who deny the harsh difficulties we face. Optimists are those who recognize
challenges and work hard to overcome them. I seek to create an America where the hopeful will not be disappointed.

And the future is with the children. We must invest in our children by giving them the best education. We
need to establish a safe environment for our children. They are the future leaders, doctors, teachers, and
parents. We can't deny our children the hope in the future they deserve. We must listen to their dreams and
give them tools and resources to see those dreams come to fruition. I want to create an America for the
children.

We must not neglect the elderly. We should take care of those who have taken care of us. I believe in a future
that is welcoming to all generations.
A vote for me is vote for optimism; it is vote for the future. promise to strive for that better future that
includes all of us. As we learn from the past, and dream of the future, I believe that we can build America as it
was always meant to be.

# Sample speech(with discourse markers added)
The future of America is with its people. Moreover, it is with the hopeful, those who believe in the immense
possibilities of our nation. In addition, it is with the fighters, the ones who are willing to sacrifice to bring forth the dream that they have for the future. Indeed, the true optimists are not those who deny the harsh
difficulties we face at the moment: on the contrary, they are the people who recognize the daunting challenges before them, and nevertheless press on to overcome them. In summary, they are the core of what America can be, what America should be, what America will be. Therefore, I seek to create an America where the hopeful will not be disappointed.

The future of America is with its children. Consequently, we must invest in our children by giving them the
best education possible. Furthermore, we must invest in our society in order to establish a safe and secure
environment where the leaders, doctors, teachers, and parents of our future can be nurtured. We must not
deny our children the hope in the future that they deserve; instead, we must listen to the dreams of their
youth, and give them the tools and resources to see those dreams come to fruition. Thus, I seek to create an
America that belongs to the children.

At the same time, in our effort to honor the youth, we must not neglect the elderly. Indeed, we cannot fail to
take care of those who have taken care of us. Essentially, I seek to create a future that is welcoming to all
generations.

In conclusion, a vote for me is a vote for optimism, a vote for hope, it is a vote for the future. I promise to
strive for that better future that includes the children, the youth, and the elderly. As we learn from the past,
and dream of the future, I believe that we can build America as it was always meant to be.
