Prof. Gilbert: Making use of this technology will **instantly benefit** some of the poorest people on Earth. Drought-resistant crops will **solve** the problem of hunger in the developing world.

Prof. Gilbert: Fine-tuning the genes of mosquitos so that they spread vaccines instead of malaria will **eliminate** many terrible diseases.

Prof. Gilbert: And, closer to home, gene screening will **enable** us to find and fix health problems before a person is even born.

Prof. Gilbert: **Who wouldn't want the ability to prevent their child from developing cancer?**

Prof. Gilbert: Being able to change the DNA of plants, animals and ourseleves will **trigger a chain reaction** of technological advancements, all of which will help us to **overcome** the challenges the future will throw at us.

A: But not all the experts are so optimistic.

A: Professor Goldman, fro Queen's College, is more cautionary.

Prof. Goldman: This is **untested technology**, and I'd **warn against** **taking a leap into** the unknown Manipulating DNA for our benefit really is '**Playing God**', and could **come back to haunt us**.

Prof. Goldman: Imagine we genetically engineer some crops and the changes **lead to** undesirable results; those changes might be **impossible to reverse**, and have a **disastrous** effect on the environment.

Prof. Goldman: It's a **slippery slope**, with **serious consequences**.

Prof. Goldman: Once we start making changes to human DNA, **who knows what terrible results it could have on our health in the future?**

Prof. Goldman: We really shouldn't be **playing around** with technology we don't fully understand yes.
