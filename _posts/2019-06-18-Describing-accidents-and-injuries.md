1. It's been a busy month for us in the health and safety department; lots of staff members hurt
themselves, I'm afraid.
2. Here are the accident reports...
3. An employee slipped on the wet floor in the bathroom.
4. She hurt herself quite badly and has a swollen knee.
5. We put an ice pack on it and sent her to the hospital.
6. One of our chefs cut himself preparing lunch in the canteen.
7. His hand was bleeding so we washed the cut, used antiseptic and gave him a bandage.
8. The receptionist complained she had a headache and was feeling dizzy.
9. She hurt herself when a book fell on her head.
10. We gave her some painkillers from the first aid kit and she's fine now.
11. George from the sales department broke his leg.
12. He was running down the stairs and tripped over an empty box.
13. I also hurt myself this week.
14. I was eating some fried chicken and bumed my mouth because it was too hot.
15. We really ought to take better care of ourselves!
