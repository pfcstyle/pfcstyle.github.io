# The order of telling a personal anecdote

1. **Lead-in**: That reminds me of my first trep abroad.
2. **Background**: I had never travelled outside of my city before, but I'd always dreamed of...
3. **Main events**: At first, I was so confused. I didn't even know how to cross the street.
4. **Outcome**: Since then, I've always looked for opportunities to experience nwe cultures.
5. **Hand-over**: How about you, John? Have you ever been to San Francisco?

# Dialogue

1. James: It was - it was pretty crazy, I'll never forget that first time I saw my new school and just thought, huh, my life is about to change in a really big way...
2. Lucy: Those kinds of moments really do stick with you.
3. James: And how about you two?
4. Did you experience something like that?
5. Maria: I still remember my own first time abroad.
6. I would've been I guess sixteen years old and- it was my friend's idea originally-we decided to apply for this student exchange program-
7. Lucy: Oh! They started offering those at my school and I-
8. Maria: And, and, and, I mean, I'd always wanted to go overseas, but I'd never thought about actually doing that in high school.
9. So the strange thing was, we both applied together, and I did it just for fun, but in the end I got in, so, off I went to Brazil!
10. James: Brazil? Wow, that's a long way to go. I heard life is pretty relaxed there
11. Maria: Yes-
12. James: -and that-
13. Maria:- althoughhh, it certainly wasnt' relaxing for me when first arrived.
14. I mean, you anticipate some culture shock and all that, but then part of you thinks, that's for other people,not for me. I'll be fine.
15. But as soon as I arrived, it was just - every little thing.
16. Lucy: Language issues?
17. Maria: Well, the language side of things was actually OK, because in the area I lived most people spoke some English.
18. It was more like-i don't know-every time I met someone, they'd hug and kiss me on the cheeks.
19. I felt this pressure to be very close friends straight away.
20. James: I guess the beaches made up for that, though, right?
21. Maria: The beaches were great-yeah, weekend after weekend, swimming, surfing, whatever we wanted to do.
22. But when I look back, it was much more than a long holiday.
23. I guess it's more the-how can I put it?
24. It's the way it's changed my outlook or my way of thinking about what's-
25. Lucy: -what's important in life.
26. Maria: Mm, before then it was just family, job, I didn't really think much beyond that. Now really make sure I'm living my life on my own terms.
27. James: Well, that's what matters, right.
28. Maria: Yep. Anyway, what about you, Lucy?
29. Were you saying that you went on a student exchange too?
30. Lucy: Well, it wasn't an exchange as such, but yes, when I was....
