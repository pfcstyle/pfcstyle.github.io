# Dialogue
1. Leslie: I think it's important to show who's in charge. So I guess if I was the HR manager, I'd just tell him that if he doesn't calm down he'd lose any benefits he'd get when he's made redundant.
2. Lillian: Really? I'm not sure I agree with you on that. I mean, if I was being made redundant I'd be pretty unhappy, too.
3. Caleb:yeah,' d say his anger is justified mean how would- do
4. Leslie: Ok, but just because it's justified doesn't mean it's appropriate. I've worked with people like that before. I mean, if his position requires him to deal with customers, do you really want to keep someone who gets angry easily?
5. Caleb: Easily? But, being laid off is a pretty good reason to be angry. Like I was saying, how would you feel if that happened to you?
6. Leslie: Well, unhappy, of course, but my point is that if he's working with customers and someone gets angry with him, how do you know he won't get angry in response?
7. Caleb: I guess you don't know, so that's a fair point, but I'm really not sure that taking away his benefits is the best answer. Lillian, what would you do?
8. Lillian: I would try to give him time to process the news and calm down.
9. Caleb: How would you do that?
10. Lillian: Suggest that we reschedule this meeting for another day.
11. Leslie: But what if he refuses? Then what would you do?
12. Caleb: Honestly, I'm not sure. I guess I would try Lillian's idea of rescheduling first and if that didn't work, only then would try something more drastic like threaten to take away his benefits
13. Leslie: Yeah, that's probably the best possible plan.
14. Lillian: Hmm...i suppose so. But I still don't like the idea of making his life harder by taking away his benefits.
