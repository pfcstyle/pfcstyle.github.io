# Dialogue

1. Tam: Your top priority last week was the company website. How's the situation now?
2. Greg: The new site is up and running all it needs is regular maintenance now.
3. Tam: Great! Do you think it's okay to hand over to Sam?
4. Greg: Hmm... The intern?
5. Tam: Yes. That way, we can free up more of your time to start setting up the network for the new office.
6. Greg: Oh, when will the new office open again?
7. Tam: The sales team will move in next month, on the 20th.
8. Greg: I see. Given the amount of time we've got, it would help if Sam could help me set up the new network,
if that's okay.
9. Tam: Does he have enough experience for that?
10. Greg: Well, we'll be working together, so can keep an eye on him. Plus, it's a good training opportunity for
both of us.
11. Tam:Ok.So, you'd rather do the maintenance work by yourself?
12. Greg: Yes, I'd say so. Especially for this first month, since the site is completely new.
13. Tam: I understand.
