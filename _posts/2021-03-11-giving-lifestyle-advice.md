# Dialogue

 1. Doris: You know, I really envy you Maureen. You can drink lattes, eat cake, and still fit into the same skinny jeans you had when you were 21.
 2. Maureen: Well that's not quite true. I do a lot of exercise. If I didn't I'd be the size of bus.
 3. Doris: Really? What do you do?
 4. Maureen: Oh, all sorts. You know, since Carlito decided to quit smoking and only drink in moderation, we spend every moment together doing something healthy.
 5. Doris: Oh, I envy you even more now. Basil and I never do anything active, he thinks you can only be healthy by being boring and eating healthier food, so we're becoming fat and lazy.
 6. Maureen: Hmm, that doesn't sound like Basil. He used to enjoy jogging in the evening didn't he?
 7. Doris: Yeah, but then he started working the late shift, and he says he doesn't get enough sleep. It's so difficult to balance life and work these days.
 8. Maureen: I know what you mean. But if you want to be happy, you had better make some changes in your life.
 9. Doris: I know, but don't know how Can you give me some advice?
 10. Maureen: Hmm, well... It's good idea to make changes slowly. You might want to eat more fruit and vegetables, and drink more water-staying hydrated is really important and gives you energy.
 11. Doris: Yes, it's hard to exercise when you're tired all the time. Can drinking water really help?
 12. Maureen: Oh yes! You have to drink water, especially when you exercise. But you know what you should really do? Laugh! Seriously, it's proven to reduce stress, which is about the worst thing for you! Laughter really is the best medicine.
