# Dialogue

1. Chen: Hey Harry, I was reading this book on English history that you told me about the other day and I was wondering-what legends are there in England?
2. Harry: Well, I can think of one really famous one.
3. There are many versions of this story and it's set hundreds of years ago.
4. They've even made a few films about it.
5. Chen: Yeah? Okay, go for it.
6. Harry: So, **there's this** guy called Robin Hood.
7. He's this amazing archer who lives in a place called Sherwood Forest.
8. **Anyway**, the rightful king of England at the time, Richard, goes off to war, and the evil King John, rules England in his place.
9. He gets this other guy, the Sheriff of Nottingham to help him get more money from the poor.
10. The Sheriff is also a bad guy in the story and he raises taxes so that he can make as much money as possible from the poor people.
11. Chen: Ah, think I may have heard this story. Carry on.
12. Harry: **Basically**, the poor people in the land find it difficult to survive as all their money's been taken in the Sheriff's taxes, you know?
13. So, **one day** Robin thinks to himself "I need to do something here", so, with a group of guys known as his Merry Men he starts to steal from the rich and give to the poor.
14. He sounds **like** a bad guy, right?
15. Well **it turns out** that he's the hero of the story.
16. Chen: Okay, so what happens next?
17. Harry: **To cut a long story short**, the Sheriff of Nottingham tries to catch Robin Hood and offers anyone who helps him a big reward
18. This Robin Hood guy, however, is too good for him and he ends up defeating the Sheriff and giving the poor back their money.
19. **In the end**, the rightful King, King Richard, returns to Sherwood Forest and peace and order are restored in the land.
20. You know Chen, I don't think I know any legends in China, but I guess there must be loads...
21. Chen: Oh yeah. I can think of four in particular...
