# Dialogue

1. Kira: Oh man! You'll never guess what happened last night!
2. Ava: Oh? What happened?
3. Kira: So, as you know I broke up with Jack last week...
4. Ava: Yeah, you said...?
5. Kira: Well, he showed up at my house!
6. Ava: Wha-...?
7. Kira: Right after we finished eating.
8. Ava: That's crazy! So, what did he want?
9. Kira: He wants to get back together.
10. Ava: Really?
11. Kira: Really!
12. Ava: And what'd your family say about him being there?
13. Kira: It turns out THEY invited him!
14. Ava: Seriously?
15. Kira: Yep.
16. Ava: I thought yoy told them that you didn't want to date him anymore! 
17. Kira: I did but apparently he called them and told them that he was DEEPLY in love with me and wanted to marry me and have like 5 children, and my mom seems to like him for some reason.
18. Ava: But you've only known him for like a month or two.
19. Kira: Yeah, and I was pretty sure from the start that he only wanted to be with me because my family's rich.
20. Ava: Hmm, it wouldn't be the first time you dated a guy like that.
21. Kira: True.
22. Ava: So what'd you do?
