# Dialogue

1. Tammy: Shall we start? Does everyone know why we're having this meeting?
2. All employees: Umm, not really...
3. Tammy: Oh, ok, not to worry. It'll be clearer soon enough.
4. There are a number of issues we need to talk about.
5. I'm sure everyone is aware that the marketing and sales teams will merge into one team soon.
6. So, the first item is, what can we do to maintain morale and ensure a smooth transition?
7. This is the biggest challenge we're facing.
8. What are your thoughts?
9. David: Err... As an IT engineer, I'm not quite sure what I can do to help with this problem. Maybe Jane has some ideas?
10. Jane: Well, our sales team's biggest concern is job cutting.
11. Tammy: About that, I'm afraid I can't make any promises, and I don't know what rumors have been going around, but there's no plan for job cutting as far as I'm aware.
12. Dan: That's good news for both teams. When will this happen?
13. Tammy: We're aiming to complete the process by the end of next month, and will keep everyone informed.
14. Jane: I'm sorry to say that this timeline is a real challenge for us.
15. Dan: I'm with Jane on that. That's a bit soon.
16. Tammy: I hear what you're saying.
17. However, I'm afraid that's no longer open for discussion.
18. The decision has been made by the board of directors.
19. Jane: What?! So we'll just have to deal with it? Hmm, ok fine! Let's talk about the next item then.
20. Tammy: Not yet, We still need to figure out how to make sure the transition goes smoothly...
