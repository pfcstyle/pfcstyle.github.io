1. Mark: Hey, Jane! Can I ask you a question?
2. Jane: Sure, What's up?
3. Mark: Well, I'm going to be graduating soon, so I'll be applying for jobs, but I'm not sure which jobs to choose. My parents say I should choose the company that pays the most but ...
4. Jane: But your're worried that **you're going to end up with a boss you hate?**
> you're going to get the result in the end with...
5. Mark: Yeah! Do you have any suggestions?
6. Jane: Sure. Several things to **keep in mind**. First, do some research about the company. What are the chances that you'll get a promotion if you **stay with the company long-term**? Also, where's the company located? How long will the **commute** be? And of course the salary is important. **Rather than** thinking about which company pays the most **though**, find out which company pays you enough to live the life you want to live. However, **none of this guarantees(there's no promise)** that you're going to like your boss, but at least you'll like everything else about the job if that happens.
7. Mark: Wow! **You've given me a lot to think about.** Thanks!
8. Jane: Glad I could be of help!
