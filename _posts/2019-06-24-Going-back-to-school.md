# Dialogue

1. Gary: Hi Grant.
2. I'm trying to figure out whether I want to go back to school or not.
3. Grant: Wow! That's a big decision.
4. Gary: I know.
5. If I chose to do it, one of the biggest advantages would be that I'd have better chances for promotion.
6. Grant: Yes, that's true.
7. It's always good to think about professional development.
8. If you had an MBA degree, it would be an obvious benefit for your career.
9. Gary: Yeah, know, but on the other hand, I would need to put my career on hold if I chose to study, and that's a huge drawback for me.
10. Grant: Hmm, yeah that's true.
11. Do you think it would be worth it?
12. Gary: Honestly, I'm not sure.
13. Apart from the opportunity for a promotion, another reason would be that it'd allow me to fulfill one of my dreams.
14. I've always wanted to continue my education.
15. Grant: Well, that sounds like the best reason to me.
16. Personally, I think you should go ahead!
17. Gary: But I would need to spend all my savings if I wanted to get an MBA
18. It would be quite tough for my wife and son.
19. Grant: You're right.
20. That would be another drawback.
21. Would you be able to apply for a loan from the bank?
22. Gary: Oh, I've never thought about that.
23. Grant: Well, why don't you find out more about that.
24. Gary: I will!
25. That's a great idea.
26. Thanks, Grant.
