Hi, Chuck.

I am writing with regard to the proposed deal with Fountain. Please find attached my final report. I've also attached a separate document with a more detailed financial analysis. Plus, I've already forwarded you the latest proposal from Fountain. I think that's all you need for now.

I'm Cc-ing Sheila, as she will need to see any comments you have.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,

Hey, Chris.

We just had a great training session at work on writing effective emails, and I thought I'd share some of it with you. You're always saying you need help.

First, make a list using bullet points, like this:

- Subject lines should be clear and concise.
- Be very careful choosing 'Reply' or 'Reply All.'
- Understand the difference between Cc and Bcc, and maybe mention in the email, 'I'm Cc-ing …'
- Check any attachments before you hit 'Send,' and a good expression to use is 'Please find attached …'
- Some other great expressions are 'I'm forwarding …' and 'Please don't hesitate to contact me.'
- Be polite. Avoid too much humor or sarcasm. This can easily be misunderstood.
- And remember, emoticons are only appropriate for informal emails. You love to use them, maybe too much!;-)
- Hope this helps!
