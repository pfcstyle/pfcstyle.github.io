# Dialogue

1. Speaker A: Weird news, right?
2. Speaker B: What are you talking about?
3. Speaker A: You haven't heard?
4. Apparently, the President has gone missing!
5. Speaker B: What?!
6. When did this happen?!
7. Speaker A: Sometime last night, I guess!
8. She was on holiday at the beach, and everyone is saying she might have drowned!
9. Speaker B: Seriously?
10. I knew she loved swimming, but I can't believe she drowned.
11. That's impossible.
12. Speaker A: I know, right?
13. Look, don't tell anyone I said this but there's a rumor going around that her husband is involved in her disappearance.
14. Speaker B: What? Seriously?
15. Speaker A: Yep, they interviewed a friend of hers on the news this morning. 
16. It turns out the president and her husband have been arguing a lot recently and I heard it's because she had an affair!
17. Speaker B: That's ridiculous.
18. Speaker A: There's even a rumor going around that he got a secret organization to kidnap her!
