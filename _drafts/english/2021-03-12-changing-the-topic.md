4. Jonathan: Oh, you like the beach?
5. I love the beach!
6. Did tell you?- I took surfing lessons a couple of years ago.
7. I can't wait to get back out there!
8. Linda: Wow, I could never go surfing.
9. I really admire anyone for doing something so exciting and risky.
10. The most dangerous thing I ever do is ride a bike in the city.
11. Jonathan: Well, I would be scared to do that with all the crazy drivers around.
12. Linda: I know exactly what you mean- there are some crazy drivers out there.
13. Jonathan: Speaking of which, have you noticed how much more traffic there is lately?
14. I remember when the streets used to be so quiet and peaceful.
15. It was much more romantic here a couple of years ago.
16. Linda: I feel exactly the same way!
