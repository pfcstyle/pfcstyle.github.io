1. Taylor:okay, so that covers opportunities, now on to our weaknesses.
2. Jade: Um, I'm sorry but where do I put eco-friendly appliances?
3. Dylan: Oh that's a strength, you should put it here.
4. Jade: Great, thanks!
5. Taylor: Wait, that isn't really a strength. It's more like an opportunity. 2
6. Dylan: Hmmm .. I see what you mean.
7. Jade: Why?
8. Taylor: Strengths are more internal opportunities are external.
9. Dylan: Yeah, put it here instead.
10. Jade: Okay. But aren't we selling those appliances? That's internal, isn't it?
11. Dylan: That is one way of looking at it, but ask yourself- do we ultimately have any control of how eco-friendly the appliances are? Are we the ones making those appliances?
12. Jade: no, guess not So external things are things we have no control over?
13. Taylor: That's right. Okay, now how about our weaknesses?
14. Dylan: Our loans?
15. Taylor: Yep, and let's not forget that we've only been in business for two years so that also affects things.

17. Jade: Ummm .. the vehicle gas mileage law?

20. Taylor: Thanks. So, is that something that's really internal?
21. Jade: Well, we'll have to get new vehicles we'll have control over which vehicles we get and why. That's internal.
22. Taylor: Yes, that's true, and purchasing new vehicles could be listed as a weakness But also consider that it's the new law that's forcing us to buy these vehicles in the first place.
23. Jade: Oh! And we don't have any control over the law. So the law is a threat, but the purchase of vehicles is a weakness.
24. Dylan: That's right!
25. Jade: Great! And I put that here.
26. Taylor: Exactly. Anything else?
27. Dylan: Hmmm... What about-?
